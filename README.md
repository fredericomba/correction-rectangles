# CORRECTION RECTANGLES

## ABOUT

This is an error-correction scheme that presents the digits in an inner rectangle and the correction digits in an outer rectangle.

## USE CASES

Not everyone has, or is comfortable with having, cameras on their electronic devices. This can be used in the situations where [quick-response codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) are not available. Instead of a picture that is read by a camera, rectangular tables of digits that can be read by a human (and is helped by error codes to detect typing errors) are the solution offered by this project.
